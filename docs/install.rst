Installation
============

The easiest way to install SliverPy is using PyPI. SliverPy should work on any platform supported by `Python's gRPC library <https://grpc.github.io/grpc/python/grpc.html>`_.

.. code-block:: console

    $ python3 -m pip install sliver-py


However, you can also manually install the package by downloading the `latest release from GitHub <https://github.com/moloch--/sliver-py/releases/latest>`_.

.. code-block:: console

    $ python3 -m pip install ./sliver-py-VERSION.tar.gz
